# Face Authentication System

This project is a **real-time face authentication system** built using **Python, OpenCV, and Face Recognition**. It captures video from the webcam, detects faces, and classifies them as **"Known"** (marked with green) or **"Unknown"** (marked with red).

## üìå Features

‚úÖ **Real-time face detection and authentication**
‚úÖ Supports **multiple known faces** stored in a folder
‚úÖ Uses **HOG-based** face detection for efficiency
‚úÖ **Frame skipping** for faster processing
‚úÖ **Persistent face tracking** for smoother visualization
‚úÖ Press **'q'** to exit the system

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Shivam-1812/Face_Authentication.git](https://github.com/Shivam-1812/Face_Authentication.git)
cd Face_Authentication
2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Ensure Python 3.x is installed, then run:

Bash

pip install opencv-python face-recognition numpy
3Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare Known Faces
Create a folder named "known_faces" in the project directory. Add images of known people (JPEG/PNG format). The filenames should be their names (e.g., john_doe.jpg).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Face Authentication System
Bash

python face_auth.py
üéØ How It Works
1Ô∏è‚É£ Loads known face images from the "known_faces" directory.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Captures video from the webcam.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Detects faces and compares them to known faces.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Displays a green box for known persons and a red box for unknown persons.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Continuously updates face states for smoother tracking.

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
You can modify these parameters inside the FaceAuthSystem class:

Parameter	Description	Default Value
tolerance	Face matching accuracy	0.55
frame_resize_ratio	Reduces frame size for faster processing	0.2
process_every_n_frames	Controls how often frames are processed	3
state_persistence_time	Time to keep face state for smoother UI	2 sec

Export to Sheets
üñ•Ô∏è Example Output (Terminal)
Bash

Loading known faces...
Total known faces loaded: 3
Starting face authentication system... Press 'q' to quit.
When a face is detected:

Known Person ‚Üí ‚úÖ Green box & name displayed
Unknown Person ‚Üí ‚ùå Red box with "Unknown"
üîÑ Git Instructions
If you face an error while pushing changes to GitHub, follow these steps:

Fetch and Merge Changes
Bash

git pull origin main --rebase
git push -u origin main
Force Push (If Needed)
Bash

git push -u origin main --force
‚ö† Warning: This will overwrite remote changes. Use with caution.

üöÄ Future Enhancements
Add Deep Learning (CNN) for better accuracy.
Integrate Face Mask Detection.
Support for multiple cameras.
üìú License
This project is open-source and free to use.

üí° Note:
Ensure your webcam is working before running the script.
The first-time recognition may take longer due to face encoding.
You can enhance accuracy by using high-quality images for known faces.
